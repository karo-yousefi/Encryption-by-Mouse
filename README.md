# Encryption-by-Mouse
Hello. This my first project on github. 

As you might know 'random' in programming is NOT truly random. So I wrote this code which
uses mouse movement as an input to generating random characters and then uses those characters
to encrypt a plain text.

Finaly it can generate a key for you in a txt file.

It's not that useful right now but i thought it's good to share this with you.
